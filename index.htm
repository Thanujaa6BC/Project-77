    <h1>What is a CONSOLE?</h1>

    <h4>A console is an operating system window
         through which a user can communicate with the 
         operating system or we can say a console is an
          application in which we can give text as an input from 
          the keyboard and get the text as an output from the computer end.</h4>

          <p>Microsoft Visual Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) 
              from Microsoft. It is used to develop computer programs,
               as well as websites, web apps, web services and mobile apps. 
               Visual Studio uses Microsoft software development platforms such
                as Windows API, Windows Forms, Windows Presentation Foundation,
                 Windows Store and Microsoft Silverlight. It can produce both 
                 native code and managed code.

            Visual Studio includes a code editor supporting IntelliSense 
            (the code completion component) as well as code refactoring.
             The integrated debugger works both as a source-level debugger
             and a machine-level debugger. Other built-in tools include a
              code profiler, designer for building GUI applications, 
              web designer, class designer, and database schema designer.
               It accepts plug-ins that expand the functionality at almost
                every levelâ€”including adding support for source control systems
                 (like Subversion and Git) and adding new toolsets like editors
                  and visual designers for domain-specific languages or toolsets
                  for other aspects of the software development lifecycle
                   (like the Azure DevOps client: Team Explorer).</p>
